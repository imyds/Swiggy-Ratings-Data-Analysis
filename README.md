This project involves the analysis of a dataset from Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform in India. The dataset contains information about 8,680 restaurants across multiple Indian cities. It includes details such as restaurant names, locations, pricing, customer ratings, food types, and delivery times.

Key aspects of the project include:

Geographic coverage: The data spans several major Indian cities, with Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai having the highest number of listed restaurants.

Restaurant metrics: Analysis of crucial factors like average ratings (3.66 out of 5) and average price (₹348.44) across all restaurants.

Cuisine diversity: Exploration of the most common food types, with Chinese, North Indian, and Indian cuisines being the most prevalent.

Performance indicators: Examination of delivery times across different cities and the relationship between price and customer ratings.

Data visualization: Creation of charts to illustrate key findings, such as the price vs. ratings scatter plot and the delivery time comparison across cities.

The project aims to provide insights into the Indian food delivery market, helping to understand consumer preferences, restaurant performance, and market trends across different urban centers in India.

Some key observations:

The dataset covers multiple cities in India, with Kolkata having the highest number of restaurants (1,346), followed by Mumbai (1,277) and Chennai (1,106).
Other major cities included are Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Surat.

The average rating across all restaurants is 3.66 out of 5.
The average price across all restaurants is ₹348.44.

The top 5 most common food types are:
Chinese (2,588 restaurants)
North Indian (1,921 restaurants)
Indian (1,772 restaurants)
Fast Food (1,550 restaurants)
Beverages (1,524 restaurants)

Delhi has the lowest average rating among all cities in the dataset.
The average delivery time in Delhi is about 51 minutes, which might be a factor contributing to the lower ratings.
Despite the lower average rating, Delhi offers a wide variety of food options, suggesting that the lower ratings might be due to factors other than food variety, such as delivery times or service quality.
It's important to note that this analysis is based on averages, and individual restaurants in Delhi may still have high ratings. The lower average could be due to various factors, including a higher number of restaurants, more diverse customer expectations, or other city-specific challenges.
